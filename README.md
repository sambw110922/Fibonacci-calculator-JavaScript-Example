# Fibonacci-calculator-JavaScript-Example
An example Fibonacci calculator using JavaScript.

This project contains:

- a web page (index.html) that provides the interface
- a JavaScript file that provides the logic (fiblogic.js)
- a CSS file that provides the style (fibstyle.css)
- a web page (mobiletest.html) that contins all of the CSS and JavaScript in the HTML for testing on mobile devices.

This example project demonstrates completing a Fibonacci sequence using recursion. 

How to use

- Download the files.
- Either click on index.html or mobiletest.html and open in a web browser.
- Enter a pair of numbers into the "sequence" area of the form (greater than 0 and less than 100). This starts off the sequence.
- Enter a number for the number of times to perform (greater than 0 and less than 50).
- The results should appear on the page.
